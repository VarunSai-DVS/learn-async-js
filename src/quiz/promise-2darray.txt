45

1. Both calls to the sum function are async.
2. They are executed and the "Sum called" is logged and at the end of the promise "returning from sum" is logged for the first call.
3. For the second call, "Sum called" is logged, the else condition is true and "rejecting" is logged and then "returning from sum".
3. Reject is logged first, and actual array sum takes some time so the resolving is printed next.
